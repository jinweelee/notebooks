##A universal small molecule, inorganic phosphate,restricts the substrate specificity of Dicer-2 in small RNA biogenesis (Fukunaga,2014)
Note, this paper is more of a review than anything else 
###Brief intro and hypothesis
How do the 2 Dicers achieve their substrate specificity?

Essentially, recent findings show that inorganic phosphate restricts the substrate specificity of Dicer-2 to long dsRNA. Inorganic phosphate inhibits Dicer-2 from binding
and cleaving pre-miRNAs, without affecting the processing of long dsRNA. 

**In dicer2 there is a phosphate-binding pocket that recognizes both the 5′-monophosphate of a substrate RNA and inorganic phosphate which is found in all cells**

The review therefore proposes that inorganic phosphate occupies the phosphate-binding pocket in the fly Dicer-2, blocking binding of pre-miRNA and restricting pre-miRNA processing to Dicer-1.


###Structure and specificity  

So both dicer1 and 2 have an N-terminal “helicase”
domain; a central, atypical dsRNAbinding
domain (dsRBD, previously
known as DUF283); a platform domain; a
PAZ domain; a connector helix; 2 RNase
III domains; and a C-terminal dsRBD.


Ok so apparently, only dcr2's and not dcr1's helicase domain requires ATP and this allows dcr2 to apparently translocate along the dsRNA.

Dicer-1 does not cleave long dsRNA,
making it specific for pre-miRNAs.12,16 In
contrast, purified, recombinant Dicer-2
efficiently cleaves pre-miRNAs, producing
miRNA products that are 1–2 nt shorter
than the authentic miRNA products produced
by Dicer-1.**Read about this in another paper, wait its another Fukunaga paper**


##Referencing miRNA_2014

Dicer-2 cleavage of pre-miRNAs is suppressed
by physiological concentrations
(8–25 mM) of inorganic phosphate in a
dose-dependent manner. **Phosphate inhibition
of Dicer-2 is specific: inorganic
phosphate affects neither the cleavage by
Dicer-2 of long dsRNA into siRNAs, nor
the cleavage by Dicer-1 of pre-miRNA into
miRNAs.**


##Interesting perspective on length of dsRNAs 
INTERESTING, **The results revealed that short
length is the determinant: inorganic phosphate
inhibits Dicer-2 cleavage of short
dsRNA (<38 bp) but not long dsRNA (>38
bp)**

In fact, **cleavage of
short dsRNA by Dicer-2 requires an end
with a 5′-monophosphate and a 2-nucleotide
3′-overhang, but not ATP, whereas
cleavage of long dsRNA requires no specific
terminal structure, but does require
ATP.**


##Origins of the phosphate binding pocket 

They then found **two evolutionarily
conserved arginine residues (Arg943 and Arg956) in the fly Dicer-2 PAZ domain
are required for short dsRNA cleavage, but dispensable for long dsRNA cleavage.**

Neither residue is present in miRNA-producing enzymes such
as fly Dicer-1, C. elegans Dicer, or human Dicer.

Then given several reports of a phosphate binding pocket in Human Dicer, they then suspected that these 2 residues form the phosphate pocket


##Unpacking the final hypothesis and R2D2 providing substrate specificity?

Reasons why Dcr2 is specific for long dsRNA/hpRNA 

**1) but that in vivo
inorganic phosphate occupies the pocket, blocking pre-miRNA binding.**


**2) For long dsRNA, the end structure of the RNA
substrate would not bind the PAZ domain.**

OR

**3)The inorganic phosphate might be displaced from the binding pocket by the 5′-monophosphate of long dsRNA because of *high-affinity interactions*
between a long dsRNA substrate and other Dicer-2 domains, such as the helicase and dsRNA-binding domains.**


Also, interesting, **R2D2, like inorganic phosphate,
also inhibits pre-miRNA processing by
Dicer-2**


##Why does the pocket even exist? 

Considering that **siRNA duplexes are
short dsRNAs**, 
we propose that binding of a siRNA duplex requires recognition of the 5′-monophosphate of the siRNA duplex by the phosphate-binding pocket of the Dicer-2 PAZ domain. 
We imagine that a bound inorganic phosphate may be displaced by the siRNA duplex and not
inhibit loading.

This is then essential for loading of mature siRNA's into AGO2? 



##Loquacious-PD removes phosphate inhibition of Dicer-2 processing of hairpin RNAs into siRNAs (Fukunaga, 2018) 

###Background info 
The most abundant endo-siRNA in vivo is esi-2.1, a hairpin 	derived
endo-siRNA. This suggests that the esi-2.1 precursor
hairpin RNA is a predominant substrate of Dicer-2.

Dicer-2 can be bound by a cofactor dsRNA-binding protein
Loquacious-PD (Loqs-PD) [13]. Loqs-PD has two dsRBDs (Fig. 1A).
The C-terminal region of Loqs-PD binds the Dicer-2 helicase
domain.

SUPER SUPER IMPORTANT, OK, THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE ARE CATCHING HERE.
**Loqs-PD is required for efficient
production of hairpin-derived endo-siRNAs (esi-1.1, esi-1.2, and esi-
2.1), cis-NAT-derived endo-siRNAs, and exo-siRNAs derived from an
inverted repeat transgene.

**In contrast, Loqs-PD is dispensable
for production of transposon-derived endo-siRNAs. (Note this is form a 2014 paper that claimed this using a loqs-KO + loqs-PB in vivo study) **

###Main thesis

However, how inorganic
phosphate affects Dicer-2 processing of hairpin RNAs with an intermediate
length remains unknown. Whether or how the inhibitory
effect of inorganic phosphate on Dicer-2 is modulated by Loqs-
PD is also unknown. 

I found that inorganic phosphate inhibits Dicer-2 alone, but not
Dicer-2 þ Loqs-PD, from processing esi-2.1 precursor hairpin RNAs
with a blunt end.

Thus, Loqs-PD allows Dicer-2 to process blunt-end
hairpin RNAs in the presence of inorganic phosphate,  **which may
explain the in vivo requirement of Loqs-PD for production of
hairpin-derived endo-siRNAs.** ahh shit 

###Main body 

Right, first of all this is an in vitro study, with purified loqs-pd, dc


###Final conclusions AND Recap of differing models of Dicer2 processing
Loqs-PD enables Dicer-2 to cleave
blunt-end hairpin RNAs in the presence of inorganic phosphate.
Similarly, previous studies showed that Loqs-PD enables Dicer-2 to
cleave RNA substrates normally refractory to cleavage, such as
dsRNA with blocked, structured, or frayed ends.

**Dicer-2 processes blunt-end RNA substrates and overhang-end RNA substrates
differently.** Blunt-end hairpin RNA substrates are
bound by the Dicer-2 helicase domain (Fig. 4A, top). The blunt-end
hairpin RNA substrates are threaded through the Dicer-2 helicase
domain until their ends reach the Dicer-2 PAZ domain. Then the
blunt-end hairpin RNA substrates are cleaved by the Dicer-2 RNase
III active sites. In contrast, 30 overhang-end hairpin RNA substrates
are bound by the Dicer-2 PAZ domain and then the 30 overhang-end
hairpin RNAs are aligned to the RNase III active sites for cleavage.

**Loqs-PD binds the Dicer-2 helicase domain [14,15].** A blunt-end
long dsRNA substrate and a 30 overhang-end long dsRNA substrate
are bound by the Dicer-2 helicase domain differently [12]. **Therefore,
Loqs-PD bound to the Dicer-2 helicase domain is also expected
to interact blunt-end hairpin RNA substrates and 30 overhang-end
hairpin RNA substrates differently.**

In vivo at a physiological concentration of inorganic phosphate,
inorganic phosphate binds the phosphate-binding pocket in the
Dicer-2 PAZ domain and inhibits access of RNA substrates to the
PAZ domain, inhibiting their cleavage (Fig. 4B) [18]. The inhibition
occurs to both blunt-end hairpin RNAs and 30 overhang-end hairpin
RNAs.

**Ahhh the helicase paper!** Loqs-PD increases the binding affinity of a blunt-end long
dsRNA substrate to Dicer-2 [15]. The binding affinity increase of
hairpin RNA substrates by Loqs-PD allows blunt-end hairpin RNAs
to displace a bound inorganic phosphate fromthe binding pocket in
the Dicer-2 PAZ domain, enabling efficient cleavage of the bluntend
hairpin RNAs

**HERES THE KEY!!!!!!!**

For some RNA substrates,including blunt-end hairpin RNAs, processing by Dicer-2 is inhibited
by phosphate while processing by Dicer-2 þ Loqs-PD is not.
Such RNA substrates require Loqs-PD for siRNA production. In
contrast, for other RNA substrates, phosphate does not inhibit
Dicer-2 from processing. Such RNA substrates do not require Loqs-
PD for siRNA production.
